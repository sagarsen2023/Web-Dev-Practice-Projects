                <p>
                    The cpmbined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develop a
                    skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young
                    ninds about how to sell yourself as a developer andb open them to a whole new world of
                    opportunities.

                    As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding back is yourself.

                <p>
                    A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.

                    "How big would you dream, if you <b>knew</b> you wouldn't fail?" You have already gone through the
                    hardest
                    parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're
                    passoniate about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm happy to vhat over a coffee some time about how I can help your company.
