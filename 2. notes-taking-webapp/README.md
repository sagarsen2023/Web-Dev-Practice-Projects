# A simple notes taking application

- **This is a simple notes taking application that uses fs module for creating and reading notes from a text file.**
- I created this project just for learning the working principle of express js and fs module.

## How to use it:

- Now open your favorite browser and type: `localhost:300` and enjoy. :)
